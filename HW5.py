# 1. Even First
# Your input is an array of integers, and you have to reorder its entries so that the even entries
# appear first. You are required to solve it without allocating additional storage (operate with
# the input array).
# Example: [7, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2] Return [6, 4, 10, 2, 7, 3, 5, 3]



# 2. Increment a Number
# Write a program that takes as input an array of digits encoding a nonnegative decimal
# integer D and updates the array to represent the integer D + 1.
# For example, if the input is [1, 2, 9] then you should update the array to [1, 3, 0].
